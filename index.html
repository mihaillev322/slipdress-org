<h2>Fabric care and longevity for satin and silk</h2>
<p>Proper care is essential for maintaining the beauty and longevity of your satin slip dress collection. Always check the care label first, but most silk and satin slip dresses benefit from gentle hand washing in cold water using a mild detergent specifically designed for delicate fabrics. Avoid harsh chemicals, bleach, or fabric softeners that can damage the fibres and affect the drape.</p>
<p>When machine washing is necessary, use the delicate cycle with cold water and place the garment in a mesh laundry bag for protection. Air drying is always preferable to machine drying – lay the dress flat on a clean towel or hang it carefully to prevent stretching. For slip dress fabric care, steaming is gentler than ironing and helps maintain the fabric's natural lustre.</p>
<p>Storage plays a crucial role in preserving your slip dresses. Hang them on padded hangers to maintain their shape, or fold them carefully with tissue paper if drawer storage is necessary. Keep them away from direct sunlight and ensure adequate air circulation to prevent moisture buildup that could lead to fabric damage or odours.</p>

<h2>Fit notes for an international wardrobe</h2>
<p>When building a slip dress wardrobe for international wear, consider climate variations and cultural comfort levels across different regions. In humid climates, natural fibres like silk offer better breathability, while synthetic blends might be more practical for frequent washing in areas with limited dry cleaning access.</p>
<p>Layering strategies become particularly important when travelling between different cultural contexts. A well-fitted slip dress for women can be styled conservatively with appropriate cover-ups or worn more minimally in relaxed settings. Consider having alterations done to ensure the perfect fit – a properly fitted slip dress will always look more polished and feel more comfortable regardless of how you choose to style it.</p>
